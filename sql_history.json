From the mapping table provided, we can see that the relevant universal code for Net Profit Margin is not explicitly listed. However, we can calculate it using the formula:\n\nNet Profit Margin = (Net Income / Revenue) * 100\n\nIn our context, we will need to fetch both Net Income and Revenue for each bank for the specified years. The universal codes for these categories are as follows:\n\n- **Net Income**: IS_100 (Profit after corporate income tax)\n- **Revenue**: IS_020 (Net Revenue)\n\nWe will then create a SQL query that retrieves this data for the specified banks and years.\n\nHere's the SQL query to achieve this:\n\n```sql\n-- Fetching Net Income and Revenue for VCB, TCB, and ACB from 2020 to 2023\nWITH financial_data AS (\n    SELECT \n        stock_code,\n        year,\n        quarter,\n        CASE \n            WHEN universal_code = 'IS_100' THEN data -- Net Income\n            WHEN universal_code = 'IS_020' THEN data -- Revenue\n        END AS value,\n        universal_code\n    FROM \n        financial_statement\n    WHERE \n        stock_code IN ('VCB', 'TCB', 'ACB')\n        AND year BETWEEN 2020 AND 2023\n        AND quarter = 0 -- Annual reports\n)\nSELECT \n    stock_code,\n    year,\n    MAX(CASE WHEN universal_code = 'IS_100' THEN value END) AS net_income,\n    MAX(CASE WHEN universal_code = 'IS_020' THEN value END) AS revenue\nFROM \n    financial_data\nGROUP BY \n    stock_code, year\nORDER BY \n    stock_code, year;\n```\n\nThis query will give us the annual Net Income and Revenue for each of the specified banks from 2020 to 2023.
