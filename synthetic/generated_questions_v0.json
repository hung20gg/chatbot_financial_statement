                    "explanation": "This question analyzes short-term liquidity. A declining current or quick ratio might indicate worsening liquidity, while an increasing ratio suggests improved ability to meet short-term obligations."

Net Profit Margin shows how much profit is generated per dollar of revenue, while ROE measures how effectively a company uses shareholder equity to generate profit. Comparing these across companies and over time provides a strong indication of profitability and efficiency."

A higher ratio indicates higher financial risk because a larger portion of the company's assets are financed by debt, increasing the company's vulnerability to economic downturns."

The Interest Coverage Ratio measures a company's ability to pay interest expenses from its earnings.

                    "explanation": "The Times Interest Earned ratio measures a company's ability to pay interest expenses with its earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT). A higher ratio indicates a lower risk of default on debt obligations."

                    "explanation": "ROA measures profitability relative to assets, while the Debt-to-Equity ratio assesses the proportion of debt financing.  Comparing these helps understand the relationship between profitability, financial leverage, and overall risk. A higher ROA is generally better, but a high Debt-to-Equity ratio, even with high ROA, could indicate higher risk."
