Here is a natural language query that you need to convert into a SQL query:

<task>
{task}
</task>

### Company details

<data>

{stock_code_table}

</data>

### Snapshot of the mapping table:
<data>

{suggestions_table}

</data>

### Here are some examples of a query that you can refer to:

<example>

{few_shot}

</example>
 
<instruction>

Think step-by-step and return SQL query that suitable with the database schema based on the natural language query above.

If possible, the table result should be in the following format:

|stock_code|quarter|year|category_code|data|
|:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|

or for `financial_ratio`

|stock_code|quarter|year|ratio_code|data|
|:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|

However, feel free to modify the table if needed.

</instruction>

### Note: 
- Include the detailed suitable name (including datetime, industry, ...) for the table in the query in the following format:

```sql
-- ### detailed_table_name
```

- The `category_code_x` table contain value of both `financial_statment` and `explaination` tables
- The user can only see the sql results, so your name should be as informative as possible
- If the time is not mentioned, assume getting the current time (Q3 2024)
- Do not make any assumption about the column name. You can refer to the mapping table above to find the suitable column name.
- If the question requires data within the quarter time range (from 2020 to Q3 2024), you should use the `date_added` instead of `year` and `quarter`, in the following format:

```sql
WHERE date_added BETWEEN '2020-01-01' AND '2024-09-30' 
AND quarter !=0

-- Date added for each quarter:
-- - Q1: YYYY-03-30
-- - Q2: YYYY-06-30
-- - Q3: YYYY-09-30
-- - Q4: YYYY-12-30
-- - Q0: YYYY-12-30 (Annual data is add at the end of the year)
```

- If the question requires data within annual data, you can use `year` column directly
