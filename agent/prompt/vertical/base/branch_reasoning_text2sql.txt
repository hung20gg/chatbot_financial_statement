You have the following database schema:

<description>
{database_description}
</description>

Here is a natural language query that you need to convert into a query:
<query>
{task}
</query>    

Note:
- You must get the financial ratio data in `financial_ratio` table.
- Your SQL query must only access the database schema provided.
- In each step, you should only do the task that is required. Do not do the task of next step.
- Make the SQL query as simple and readable as possible. Utilize existing data from previous steps to avoid unnecessary query.
- You are penalized if generating wrong or meaningless SQL query 
- If the data provided is enough to answer the question, you don't have to return SQL query.
        
Here are the steps to break down the task:
<steps>
{steps_string}
</steps>      

Snapshot of the mapping table:
