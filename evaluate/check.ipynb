We'll also need to prepare to calculate their current and quick ratios from the gathered data.\\n\\n### Steps to Build the SQL Query:\\n1. **Identify Relevant Category Codes**:\\n   - Current Assets: `BS_100`\\n   - Current Liabilities: `BS_310`\\n   - For Quick Ratio calculation, we also need Short-term Receivables: `BS_140` and Current Inventories: `BS_161`.\\n\\n2. **Filter for Specific Companies and Quarters**:\\n   - We'll target HPG, VHM, and MSN.\\n   - We will select data for Q2 2022 (year 2022, quarter 2) and Q2 2023 (year 2023, quarter 2).\\n\\n3. **Select Relevant Data**:\\n   - Gather data including stock_code, year, quarter, category_code, and data.\\n   - We will also need to compute the summary for ratio calculations later.\\n\\n4. **Naming Convention for Query**:\\n   - We will add a detailed comment above the query to specify the information being retrieved.\\n\\n### SQL Query:\\nHere is the SQL query that achieves the above goals:\\n\\n```sql\\n-- ### Current Assets and Current Liabilities of HPG, VHM, and MSN for Q2 2022 and Q2 2023\\nSELECT\\n    stock_code,\\n    year,\\n    quarter,\\n    category_code,\\n    data\\nFROM\\n    financial_statement\\nWHERE\\n    stock_code IN ('HPG', 'VHM', 'MSN')\\n    AND ((year = 2022 AND quarter = 2) OR (year = 2023 AND quarter = 2))\\n    AND category_code IN ('BS_100', 'BS_310', 'BS_140', 'BS_161')\\nORDER BY\\n    stock_code, year, quarter, category_code\\nLIMIT 100;\\n\\n```\\n\\n### Explanation:\\n- The query selects current assets and liabilities along with short-term receivables and inventories, which are essential for calculating ratios.\\n- It filters only for Q2 of 2022 and Q2 of 2023 and includes relevant companies.\\n- The result is ordered for better clarity in the output and is limited to 100 entries to avoid returning overly large result sets, as requested.\\n\\nThis query can then be executed to retrieve the required financial data for the specified companies and periods. Subsequent calculations for the current and quick ratios and any notable changes can be performed based on this retrieved data.\", 'table': '**Company Information**\\n\\n| stock_code | en_company_name | industry | is_bank | is_securities |\\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\\n| HPG | Hoa Phat Group Joint Stock Company | Basic Resources | False | False | \\n| VHM | Vinhomes Joint Stock Company | Real Estate | False | False | \\n| MSN | Masan Group Corporation | Food and Beverages | False | False | \\n\\n**Category Mapping**\\n\\nList of category_code with corresponding en_caption\\n- BS_100: (Balance sheet) A.

This indicates that the requested data might not be available in the `financial_ratio` table for the specified criteria. While the query itself is syntactically correct and logically sound for retrieving DPO, the lack of results suggests that we need to consider if there\\'s an alternative approach or if the data simply doesn\\'t exist.\\n\\nGiven that the user is asking for \"accounts payable turnover ratio\" and we interpreted it as DPO, and DPO is not available, we should check if there are other related ratios or if we have misinterpreted the user\\'s request.\\n\\nLooking at the `ratio_code_mapping`, \\'RTPR\\' (Receivables To Payables Ratio) is another ratio related to payables. While not directly \"accounts payable turnover ratio\", it is still relevant to assessing a company\\'s payment efficiency by comparing receivables to payables.\\n\\nLet\\'s try to retrieve \\'RTPR\\' for Eximbank in 2021 as an alternative. If this also returns no result, it would further suggest that there might be no pre-calculated payable-related ratios for EIB in 2021 in the `financial_ratio` table.\\n\\nTherefore, a \"corrected\" approach would be to try retrieving \\'RTPR\\' as an alternative, acknowledging that DPO was the initial and more direct interpretation of \"accounts payable turnover ratio\".\\n\\n### SQL Query:\\n```sql\\n-- ### financial_ratio\\nSELECT\\n    stock_code,\\n    year,\\n    quarter,\\n    ratio_code,\\n    data\\nFROM financial_ratio\\nWHERE ratio_code = \\'RTPR\\'\\n  AND year = 2021\\n  AND quarter = 0\\n  AND stock_code = \\'EIB\\'\\nLIMIT 100;\\n```'},\n",

EQUITY'. We will use these `category_code` values to retrieve the corresponding financial data.\\n\\n2. **Filter for Healthcare Industry:** We need to select companies belonging to the 'Healthcare' industry from the `company_info` table.\\n\\n3. **Filter for the Time Period:** The query needs to cover the period from Q3 2020 to Q3 2024. We should filter the `financial_statement` table based on `date_added` to include data within this timeframe and ensure `quarter` is not 0 for quarterly reports.\\n\\n4. **Calculate Equity Multiplier:** For each company and quarter, we need to calculate the Equity Multiplier by dividing 'TOTAL ASSETS' by 'TOTAL EQUITY'.\\n\\n5. **Calculate Industry Average Equity Multiplier:** For each quarter, we need to calculate the average Equity Multiplier across all companies in the Healthcare industry.\\n\\n6. **Combine and Present Results:** We should present the results in a table format showing the stock code, year, quarter, company's Equity Multiplier, and the industry average Equity Multiplier for comparison.\\n\\nBased on these steps, the SQL query is constructed to join `company_info` and `financial_statement` tables, filter for the 'Healthcare' industry and the specified time period, calculate the Equity Multiplier for each company, and then calculate the industry average Equity Multiplier for each quarter.\\n\\n### SQL Query:\\n```sql\\n-- ### quarterly_equity_multiplier_healthcare_industry\\nWITH CompanyEquityMultiplier AS (\\n    SELECT\\n        ci.stock_code,\\n        ci.industry,\\n        fs.year,\\n        fs.quarter,\\n        SUM(CASE WHEN fs.category_code = 'BS_270' THEN fs.data ELSE NULL END) AS total_assets,\\n        SUM(CASE WHEN fs.category_code = 'BS_400' THEN fs.data ELSE NULL END) AS total_equity\\n    FROM\\n        company_info ci\\n    JOIN\\n        financial_statement fs ON ci.stock_code = fs.stock_code\\n    WHERE\\n        ci.industry = 'Healthcare'\\n        AND fs.quarter != 0\\n        AND fs.date_added BETWEEN '2020-07-01' AND '2024-09-30' -- Q3 2020 to Q3 2024\\n        AND fs.category_code IN ('BS_270', 'BS_400')\\n    GROUP BY\\n        ci.stock_code, ci.industry, fs.year, fs.quarter\\n    HAVING\\n        SUM(CASE WHEN fs.category_code = 'BS_270' THEN fs.data ELSE NULL END) IS NOT NULL\\n        AND SUM(CASE WHEN fs.category_code = 'BS_400' THEN fs.data ELSE NULL END) IS NOT NULL\\n),\\nIndustryAverageEquityMultiplier AS (\\n    SELECT\\n        industry,\\n        year,\\n        quarter,\\n        AVG(total_assets / total_equity) AS avg_industry_equity_multiplier\\n    FROM\\n        CompanyEquityMultiplier\\n    GROUP BY\\n        industry, year, quarter\\n)\\nSELECT\\n    cem.stock_code,\\n    cem.industry,\\n    cem.year,\\n    cem.quarter,\\n    (cem.total_assets / cem.total_equity) AS company_equity_multiplier,\\n    iaem.avg_industry_equity_multiplier\\nFROM\\n    CompanyEquityMultiplier cem\\nJOIN\\n    IndustryAverageEquityMultiplier iaem ON cem.industry = iaem.industry AND cem.year = iaem.year AND cem.quarter = iaem.quarter\\nORDER BY\\n    cem.year, cem.quarter, cem.stock_code\\nLIMIT 100;\\n```\"},\n",
