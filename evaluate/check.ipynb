      "1. **Identify the Metrics:**\n",
      "   - **Accounts Receivable Turnover**: This is typically calculated as Net Revenue / Average Accounts Receivable. However, since we are instructed to use pre-calculated ratios, we will look for a ratio that represents this metric.\n",
      "   - **Days Sales Outstanding (DSO)**: This is calculated as (Accounts Receivable / Net Revenue) * Number of Days. Again, we will look for a pre-calculated ratio.\n",

      "   - The companies of interest are FPT, Vingroup (VIC), and Masan Group (MSN).\n",

      "3. **Time Frame:**\n",
      "   - The query is specifically for Q2 2024.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Subsidiaries/Investments:**\n",
      "   - The subsidiaries or investments of these companies might affect their accounts receivable and DSO. However, the query does not require us to directly analyze the subsidiaries' financials, but rather to consider their influence.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Mapping the Metrics:**\n",
      "   - From the `map_category_code_ratio` table, we need to identify the ratio codes that correspond to Accounts Receivable Turnover and DSO. However, the provided mapping table does not explicitly list these ratios. Therefore, we will assume that the relevant ratios are available in the `financial_ratio` table.\n",

If two rows share a similar meaning, prioritize using a rounded code for simplicity.\\n- Some accounts (`en_caption`) are specific to either corporation, banks or securities firms, resulting in variations in the number of accounts across companies. Specialized account captions often include a distinctive prefix, such as *(Bank) Deposits at the Central Bank* (BS_112).\\n- The YoY ratio in `financial_ratio` only cover the rate related to the previous year (Q3-2023 vs Q3-2022).

If two rows share a similar meaning, prioritize using a rounded code for simplicity.\\n- Some accounts (`en_caption`) are specific to either corporation, banks or securities firms, resulting in variations in the number of accounts across companies.
