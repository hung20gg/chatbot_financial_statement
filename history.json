The English translation of the \ncategories are followed by the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS).\n\nThere are 3 type of financial statments, based on VAS regulation: bank, non-bank corporation and securities firm (firms that provide stock options and financial instruments).\nAll 3 type of reports are stored in one single table, and there will be a sight different between them.\n\nThe database includes two reporting periods for financial statements: quarterly and annually. Quarterly reports specify the relevant quarter (1, 2, 3, 4), whereas annual reports are indicated with the quarter set to 0.\n\n</overall_description>\n\nYou are given 6 tables in the database. Here are the detailed descriptions of them in PostgreSQL format:\n\n### PostgreSQL tables, with their properties\n```sql \n-- Table: company_info\nCREATE TABLE company_info(\n    stock_code VARCHAR(255) primary key, --The trading symbol.\n    industry VARCHAR(255), --Current industry of company. \n    exchange VARCHAR(255), -- The market where the stock is listed (e.g., HOSE, HNX)\n    stock_indices VARCHAR(255), -- The stock index it belongs to (e.g., VN30, HNX30)\n    is_bank BOOLEAN, --Bool checking whether the company is a bank or not.\n    is_securities BOOLEAN, --Bool checking whether the company is a securities firm or not.\n    issue_share int --Number of share issued.\n);\n\n-- Table: sub_and_shareholder\nCREATE TABLE sub_and_shareholder(\n    stock_code VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL, \n    invest_on VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL, -- The company invested on (can be subsidiary)\n    FOREIGN KEY (stock_code) REFERENCES company_info(stock_code),\n    FOREIGN KEY (invest_on) REFERENCES company_info(stock_code),\n    PRIMARY KEY (stock_code, invest_on) \n);\n\n-- Table: map_category_code_universal: Mapping account table for Financial Statement\nCREATE TABLE map_category_code_universal(\n    universal_code VARCHAR(255) primary key, --The unique code for accounts recorded in the financial statements.\n    universal_caption VARCHAR(255), --The Accounts (Caption) for the `universal_code`.\n);\n\n-- Table: financial_statement: Financial Statement data for each `stock_code`\nCREATE TABLE financial_statement(\n    stock_code VARCHAR(255) references company_info(stock_code),\n    year int, -- The reported financial year\n    quarter int, --  The quarter reported (contain value either 0, 1, 2, 3, 4).

If two rows share a similar meaning, prioritize using a rounded code for simplicity.\n- Some accounts (`universal_caption`) are specific to neither corporation, banks or securities firms, resulting in variations in the number of accounts across companies. Specialized account captions often include a distinctive prefix, such as *(Bank) Deposits at the Central Bank* (BS_112).\n\n### Peek view of the schema\n - `company_info`\n\n|stock_code|industry|issue_share|is_bank|is_securities|exchange|stock_indices\n|:----|:----|:----|:----|:----|:----|:----|\n|VIC|Real Estate|3823700000|false|false|HOSE|VN30|\n\n- `sub_and_shareholder`\n\n|stock_code|invest_on|\n|:---|:---|\n|MSN|TCB|\n\nExplain:\nThis mean MSN is a shareholder of TCB. \n\n- `financial_statement`\n\n|stock_code|year|quarter|universal_code|data|date_added|\n|:----|:----|:----|:----|:----|:----|\n|VCB|2023|  0 | BS_300 | 1839613.198 | 2023-12-30 |\n|LPB|2024|  2 | CF_045 | 68522.835| 2024-06-30 |\n|BID|2024|  1 | IS_014 | 5392.606 | 2024-03-30 |\n\n- `map_category_code_universal`\n\n|universal_code|universal_caption|\n|:----|:----|\n|BS_100| (Balance sheet) A.
