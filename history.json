Please provide the steps.\n\n<<SYS>>\n\nYou are a financial analyst at a company. You are tasked to break down the shareholders' question into simpler steps.    \n\n<question>\n\nAmount of customer deposits in BIDV and Vietcombank in Q2 2023\n\n</question>\n\nHere are some information you might need:        \n\nYou can have access to these databases:\n- `financial_statement` : Contain all information of financial statement, including balance sheet, income statement and cash flow statement.\n- `financial_ratio` : Contain pre-calculated financial performance ratios (liquidity, profitability, financial structure, ...) from all financial reports.\n- `company_info`: Contain all information of a company (profile, stock code, industry, ...)\n- `sub_and_shareholder`: Contain information about ownership or investment of a company to another company.\n\nNote: If you select quarter only, quarter must not be 0. And if you select data by year, quarter must be 0\n   \n\n<example>\n\n#### Task: ROA, ROE of all the company which are owned by VinGroup\n\n- Step 1: Find the stock code of the company that is owned by VinGroup in `df_sub_and_shareholders` table.\n- Step 2: Get ROA, ROE of the chosen stock codes in the `financial_ratio` table.\n\n</example>\n\n<task>\n\nBreak down the question into smaller tasks, each representing an SQL task for data exploration, to ultimately answer the given question.\n\n</task>\n\nNote:\n - You should provide general steps to solve the question, and each step should be a as independence as possible. \n - You must not provide the SQL query. \n - In each step, you must provide specific task that should be done and gather the necessary data for the next step. Tasks such as retrieve all data, get all information,.. are not allowed.\n - The financial ratio has been pre-calculated and stored in the `financial_ratio` table. Do not task to calculate the financial ratio again.\n - The number of steps should be lowest if possible. You will be heavily penalized if create meaningless steps\n - You must not provide the steps that are too obvious or easy for an SQL query (retrieve and data,..).\n \nBased on the question and database, answer and return the steps in JSON format.\n\n```json\n{\n    \"steps\" : [\"Step 1\", \"Step 2\"]\n}\n```  \n    \nEach step is a string."

The English translation of the \ncategories are followed by the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS).\n\nThere are 3 type of financial statments, based on VAS regulation: bank, non-bank corporation and securities firm (firms that provide stock options and financial instruments).\nAll 3 type of reports are stored in one single table, and there will be a sight different between them.\n\nThe database includes two reporting periods for financial statements: quarterly and annually. Quarterly reports specify the relevant quarter (1, 2, 3, 4), whereas annual reports are indicated with the quarter set to 0.\n\n</overall_description>\n\nYou are given 6 tables in the database. Here are the detailed descriptions of them in PostgreSQL format:\n\n### PostgreSQL tables, with their properties\n```sql \n-- Table: company_info\nCREATE TABLE company_info(\n    stock_code VARCHAR(255) primary key, --The trading symbol.\n    industry VARCHAR(255), --Current industry of company. \n    exchange VARCHAR(255), -- The market where the stock is listed (e.g., HOSE, HNX)\n    stock_indices VARCHAR(255), -- The stock index it belongs to (e.g., VN30, HNX30)\n    is_bank BOOLEAN, --Bool checking whether the company is a bank or not.\n    is_securities BOOLEAN, --Bool checking whether the company is a securities firm or not.\n    issue_share int --Number of share issued.\n);\n\n-- Table: sub_and_shareholder\nCREATE TABLE sub_and_shareholder(\n    stock_code VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL, \n    invest_on VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL, -- The company invested on (can be subsidiary)\n    FOREIGN KEY (stock_code) REFERENCES company_info(stock_code),\n    FOREIGN KEY (invest_on) REFERENCES company_info(stock_code),\n    PRIMARY KEY (stock_code, invest_on) \n);\n\n-- Table: map_category_code_universal: Mapping account table for Financial Statement\nCREATE TABLE map_category_code_universal(\n    universal_code VARCHAR(255) primary key, --The unique code for accounts recorded in the financial statements.\n    universal_caption VARCHAR(255), --The Accounts (Caption) for the `universal_code`.\n);\n\n-- Table: financial_statement: Financial Statement data for each `stock_code`\nCREATE TABLE financial_statement(\n    stock_code VARCHAR(255) references company_info(stock_code),\n    year int, -- The reported financial year\n    quarter int, --  The quarter reported (contain value either 0, 1, 2, 3, 4).

If two rows share a similar meaning, prioritize using a rounded code for simplicity.\n- Some accounts (`universal_caption`) are specific to neither corporation, banks or securities firms, resulting in variations in the number of accounts across companies. Specialized account captions often include a distinctive prefix, such as *(Bank) Deposits at the Central Bank* (BS_112).\n\n### Peek view of the schema\n - `company_info`\n\n|stock_code|industry|issue_share|is_bank|is_securities|exchange|stock_indices\n|:----|:----|:----|:----|:----|:----|:----|\n|VIC|Real Estate|3823700000|false|false|HOSE|VN30|\n\n- `sub_and_shareholder`\n\n|stock_code|invest_on|\n|:---|:---|\n|MSN|TCB|\n\nExplain:\nThis mean MSN is a shareholder of TCB. \n\n- `financial_statement`\n\n|stock_code|year|quarter|universal_code|data|date_added|\n|:----|:----|:----|:----|:----|:----|\n|VCB|2023|  0 | BS_300 | 1839613.198 | 2023-12-30 |\n|LPB|2024|  2 | CF_045 | 68522.835| 2024-06-30 |\n|BID|2024|  1 | IS_014 | 5392.606 | 2024-03-30 |\n\n- `map_category_code_universal`\n\n|universal_code|universal_caption|\n|:----|:----|\n|BS_100| (Balance sheet) A.
